## An App With Vision

**It's Important** to remember - not all things end up being what they started as. The vision is the starting point, and the road to realization is paved with obstacles.

**But** that nugget of wisdom aside, let's start with what 'we' (and by we, I mean you and I dear carbon-based-life-form), actually want to accomplish. What's the thing we want to give to people ...

**Knowledge?**
**Information?**
**A way to make sense of the world?**

No. That's not what we want.

We want to ... do something of consequence ... something that makes a difference?
